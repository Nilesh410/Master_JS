/* Can you explain why expressions can appear within statements but statements cannot appear within expressions in JavaScript?
This distinction arises from how JavaScript interprets and executes expressions and statements in its grammar and execution model. Letâ€™s break it down:

1. What Are Expressions?
An expression in JavaScript is any valid unit of code that produces a value.

Examples of expressions:

javascript
Copy code
5 + 3;         // Arithmetic expression
x > 10;        // Comparison expression
"Hello" + "World"; // String concatenation
myFunction();  // Function call
Where Can Expressions Be Used?

Expressions can be used anywhere a value is expected (e.g., as an argument to a function, in an assignment, etc.).
Example:
javascript
Copy code
let result = 5 + 3; // Expression on the right-hand side
console.log(x > 10); // Expression inside the function call
2. What Are Statements?
A statement in JavaScript performs an action. It does not necessarily produce a value directly.

Examples of statements:

javascript
Copy code
let x = 5;       // Variable declaration statement
if (x > 0) {     // Conditional statement
    console.log(x);
}
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) { // Loop statement
    console.log(i);
}
Where Can Statements Be Used?

Statements define control flow and structure of the code.
They cannot be used directly where a value is expected.
Key Difference: Expressions vs. Statements
Feature	Expressions	Statements
Produces a Value	Always produces a value.	May or may not produce a value.
Purpose	To compute and return values.	To perform actions or control flow.
Usage	Can appear in other expressions or statements.	Cannot appear inside expressions.
Why Expressions Can Appear in Statements?
Statements often involve performing actions based on values, and since expressions produce values, they can be included in statements. For example:

In an if statement:

javascript
Copy code
if (x > 0) {  // x > 0 is an expression producing true or false
    console.log("Positive");
}
In an assignment statement:

javascript
Copy code
let result = 5 + 3;  // 5 + 3 is an expression producing 8
Here, the expressions are subcomponents of the statement.

Why Statements Cannot Appear in Expressions?
Expressions are designed to produce values, but statements are designed to perform actions and control flow. Including a statement where a value is expected (in an expression) would break the grammar and intent of JavaScript.

Invalid Example:

javascript
Copy code
let result = if (x > 0) { "Positive"; }; // Syntax Error
The if statement does not produce a value. It is meant to direct the flow of the program.
Reason:

JavaScript requires expressions in certain places (like assignments or arguments), and statements don't produce values directly. Statements like if, for, and while are designed for structural purposes and cannot be used as part of expressions.
A Notable Exception: The Conditional (Ternary) Operator
The ternary operator (condition ? expr1 : expr2) acts as an expression-based alternative to if-else.

Example:

javascript
Copy code
let message = x > 0 ? "Positive" : "Non-positive"; // Produces a value
Here, the ternary operator is an expression, so it works where a value is needed.

Summary
Expressions can appear within statements because statements often operate on values that expressions produce.
Statements cannot appear within expressions because they do not produce values and are designed to control the program's flow.
This distinction ensures clear and predictable grammar in JavaScript. */
